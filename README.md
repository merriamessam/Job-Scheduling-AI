# Job Scheduling Problem Solver  
Backtracking Search Algorithm & Genetic Algorithm

---

## Objectives

This guide walks you through the process of:

- Solving the Job Scheduling Problem using AI techniques
- Implementing a Backtracking Search Algorithm
- Developing a Genetic Algorithm for optimization
- Handling constraints like resource limits and job dependencies
- Comparing performance between two AI algorithms
- Using GitHub for version control

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed
- Basic knowledge of AI and scheduling problems
- GitHub account (to clone the repo and manage versions)

---

## 1. Workflow

Define Problem ➝ Apply Algorithms ➝ Generate Schedules ➝ Evaluate ➝ Compare

---

## 2. Test

To run the backtracking algorithm:

```bash
python backtracking.py
